      Design Name: Desktop Navbar for a Revenue Management Platform

      Description: A clean and structured navigation bar designed for desktop view, ensuring ease of navigation for accessibility-focused websites. The layout consists of a logo positioned on the left, three evenly spaced navigation links in the center, and a prominent "Sign In" call-to-action text accompamnied by a right arrow right-aligned. 
      The navbar includes a **top border line** that serves as a subtle decorative element.

      Industry: Suitable for businesses and startups providing revenue management solutions e.g collection, billing, and financial operations.

      Colors:
         - **Top Border Line:** Linear Gradient (left to right, #77E8E9 â†’ #716FFF) for a modern and vibrant look.
         - **Background:** White (#FFFFFF) for a professional and clean appearance.
         - **Text:** Black (#1D1D20) for strong readability.
         - **Call-to-action (CTA) Button:** Black (#1D1D20) text and a matching black right arrow icon to ensure high contrast.

      Design Accessibility Considerations:
      - Fixed-width navigation layout for structured positioning.
      - Adequate spacing between elements to improve readability.
      - High-contrast colors to ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG AA).
